		<pre>
			 It looks like you’re new here.
			 It looks like you don’t know what happened.
			 Perhaps she knows the answer.
			 I’d say it’s over 9 A.M now.
			 If I had to take a guess, I’d say he’s 40.
			 Maybe he wants to quit his job.
			 Maybe it’s going to rain.
			 Chances are you’re doing it wrong
			 He could be right about it.
			 I guess you are over 30 years old.
			 It’s difficult to say, but I think this is the best English course.
			 I’m not really sure, but I think this is the last morning train.
