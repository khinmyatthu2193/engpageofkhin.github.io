		<pre> 
			 You should try to learn English everyday.
			 I think you should go home early.
			 Why don’t you join an English club?
			 You’d better wake up early.
			 Let’s have dinner together.
			 What about having a cup of coffee with me?
			 How about going to the cinema?
			 Don’t you think it would be a good idea to have a picnic this Sunday.
			 If I were you, I’d call her.
			 I suggest that you take a nap.
			 You may want to try on this T-shirt.
			 Perhaps you could take an umbrella with you.
			 I strongly advise you to do more work out.

			 I recommend that you get some rest.
			 It’s better for you to sleep a little more.

			 Accepting Suggestions:

			 Thanks, I’ll do it.
			 It sounds good.
			 That sounds like a good idea.
			 Thanks. It’s a good suggestion.
			 I think you’re right.
			 Why didn’t I think of that?

			 Refusing suggestions:
			 
			 No, I’d rather not.
			 I don’t think so.
			 I don’t feel like it.
			 No, I don’t this it’s a good idea.
			 What a bad idea!
