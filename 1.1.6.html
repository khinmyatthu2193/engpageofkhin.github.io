		<h1>6.Talking about time</h1><br>
		<pre>
			 What time is it?
			 What’s the time?
			 Could you tell me the time?
			 Do you know what time it is?
			 How long have you been waiting?
			 Do you have free time this afternoon?
			 What time can we meet?
			 What should we do to kill time?

			 It’s ten o’clock.
			 It’s midnight.
			 It’s 6 A.M now.
			 See you at 8 P.M.
			 I can’t tell you exactly what time we will arrive.
			 It’s too late now.
			 My watch is stopped.
			 My watch is slow. 
			 Don’t waste your time doing nothing.
			 I didn’t think it was so late.
			 We have plenty of time.
			 Give me a little more time.
			 It’s time to leave.
			 It’s almost time to go home.
			 Time went by so fast.
			 
			 The supermarket opens at 9 a.m.
			 The class starts at 8 in the morning.
